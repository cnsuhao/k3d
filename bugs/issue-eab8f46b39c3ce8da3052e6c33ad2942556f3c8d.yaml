title: " BevelFaces only works on one face at a time? "
desc: |-
  I am trying to bevel faces. SO i select the faces and apply bevel from
  create-polygons-bevel faces. It does not do anything. But if i use right
  click mesh modifier-bevel, it works. Problem with that one is that it does
  not work with multiple face selection, it only applies to one of the
  selected faces
